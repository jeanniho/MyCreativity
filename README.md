# MyCreativity

The aim was to create an application where upcoming artists could showcase their work to both fans and possible sponsors. An artist have the option of uploading an image, a video, or audio. There are options available for a selected 'art' such as commenting. The application functions but not 100%.
It is worth mentioning my friend Katlego as a collaborator to this project.
